=head1 NAME

Number::Closest::XS - find numbers closest to a given

=head1 VERSION

0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Number::Closest::XS qw(:all);
    my $res = find_closest_numbers($num, \@list, $amount);
    my $res2 = find_closest_numbers_around($num, \@list, $amount);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module provides functions to extract from the list numbers closest to the
given.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 find_closest_numbers($num, \@list, [$amount])

selects from the I<@list> up to I<$amount> numbers closest to the I<$num>. If
I<$amount> is not specified, is assumed to be 1.  Returns reference to the
array containing found numbers sorted by the distance from the I<$num>.
Distance between C<$num> and C<$x> computed as C<abs($num - $x)>.

=head2 find_closest_numbers_around($num, \@list, [$amount])

selects from the I<@list> up to I<$amount> numbers closest to the I<$num>.
Tries to select equal amounts of numbers from both sides of the I<$num>, but if
there are not enough numbers from one side will select more numbers from the
other. If I<$amount> is odd, then the last number will be closest to I<$num>,
e.g. if $num is 5, @list is 1, 2, 6, 7, and amount is 3 it will return 2, 6,
and 7, because 7 is closer to 5 than 1.  If I<$amount> is not specified, is
assumed to be 2. Returns reference to the array containing closest numbers
sorted by their values.
